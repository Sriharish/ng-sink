# angular-material2-kitchen-sink

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-material2-kitchen-sink)

## Why?

- Documentation sites are basic (a lot of times).
- A lot of developers need an accesible place to experiement with custom components because frameworks like @angular/material2 don't necessarily offer the required styles.
- The community often fills @angular/material2 GitHub with issues that fulfill the request of the few instead of the many.
- The kitchen sink app concept isn't often used in organizations (especially those that don't have dedicated design teams). The Angular team even uses a kitchen sink called 'dev-app' for developing and testing new components for @angular/material2, however this is only obvious to the most curious of developers who clone and experiment with @angular/material2 on their own.
- Kitchen sinks are a great way to brainstorm and come up with new ideas on how to expand front-end frameworks!
